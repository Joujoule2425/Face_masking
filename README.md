# Face_masking
This project provides a lightweight and easy-to-use system for face detection and anonymization in images, video, and webcam streams. It uses [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) for accurate face detection and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to apply face-blurring or masking for privacy protection.
